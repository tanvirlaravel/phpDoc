	<h3>What is a PHP File?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>PHP files can contain text, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP code</li>
        <li>PHP code is executed on the server, and the result is returned to the browser as plain HTML</li>
    </ol>

    <p>With PHP you are not limited to output HTML. You can output images, PDF files, and even Flash movies. You can also output any text, such as XHTML and XML.</p>
