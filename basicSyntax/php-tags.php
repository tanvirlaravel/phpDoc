<h2 class="my-4 text-info text-center">PHP tags</h2>

<p>When PHP <span class="text-info" title="resolve (a sentence) into its component parts and describe their syntactic roles./analyse (a string or text) into logical syntactic components.">parses</span> a file, it looks for opening and closing tags, which are &lt;?php and ?&gt; which tell PHP to start and stop interpreting the code between them. Parsing in this manner allows PHP to be embedded in all sorts of different documents, as everything outside of a pair of opening and closing tags is ignored by the PHP parser.</p>
